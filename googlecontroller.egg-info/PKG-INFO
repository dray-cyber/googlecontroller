Description: # googlecontroller
        
        Library for Python 3.8+ to push text message or audio file with the Google Home.Originally made by - Thomas Deblock (@tdeblock) I have expanded most of the code quite a bit little of the original remains, but the idea came from Mr.Deblock.This is a sorta v2 for the googlehomepush module they made.
        
        ## This is now officially broken and will no longer be updated.If you are better at python then I take a shot at this problem.Fork this repo, do what you must.

        - `text` is the test message to say
        - `speed` is the rate of speed of the message ranges from 0.000+ as slowest to 1 as normal speed.
        - `ignore` ignore if audio is playing and play it regardless if ignore=True and only play if not playing if ignore=False or is not specified. 
        - `lang` the text language, default value is 'en' to change it have lang = 'language' as described in google translate en-Us, es (spanish), ect
        
        ### .play(url, ignore, contentType = 'audio/mp3'):

        ### .volume(volumelevel):
        - `volumelevel` the volume level from 0-100 Example: home.volume(5) or home.volume(volumelevel=5). If you want to take it as user input you can do home.volume(volumelevel=input()).
