# googlecontroller
GITHUB EXCLUSIVE KNOWLEDGE FOR SERVE_MEDIA HERE
Library for Python 3.9+ to push text message or audio file with the Google Home.Originally made by - Thomas Deblock (@tdeblock) I have expanded most of the code quite a bit little of the original remains, but the idea came from Mr.Deblock.This is a sorta v2 for the googlehomepush module they made.

## How to use

``` python
from googlecontroller import GoogleAssistant
from googlecontroller.http_server import serve_file # for local files
host = "ip"
home = GoogleAssistant(host=host)
home.say("test")
home.play("http://www.hubharp.com/web_sound/BachGavotteShort.mp3")

#When serving media NEVER USE A \ ONLY USE /
#when doing your first home.serve_media you have to include a 3rd variable, opentunnle!For that 1 first time you have to set it manually to a 0!
#opentunnel = 0
#like this home.serve_media("YourMedia.mp3", "C:/Users/YOU!/Music/", opentunnel)
#**then never use that variable again**
home.serve_media("YourMedia.mp3", "C:/Users/YOU!/Music/") # 1st is the name of the media, second is the full path to media location!
home.volume(100)
home.volume(0)

```
